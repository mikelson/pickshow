<h1>PickShow Screen Saver</h1>
    
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
        
        PickShow Screen Saver is a screen saver utility that you can install on your Mac OS X computer.
        It lets you pick a folder on your hard drive, then, when your screen saver starts, it will show you all the pictures in that folder in random order.
        If you like, you can choose subfolders to not show (such as the ones with embarassing photos).
        In addition, while the screen saver is running, you can use your keyboard to skip pictures you don't want to see, go back to ones you want to see again, move a really bad picture to the Trash, or exit the screen saver and open an interesting picture in Finder.
